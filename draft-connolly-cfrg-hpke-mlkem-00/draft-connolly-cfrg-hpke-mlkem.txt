                 draft-connolly-cfrg-hpke-mlkem-latest

Abstract

   This memo defines the ML-KEM-768-based and ML-KEM-1024-based
   ciphersuites for HPKE (RFC9180).  ML-KEM is believed to be secure
   even against adversaries who possess a quantum computer.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   The final draft for ML-KEM is expected in 2024.  For parties that
   must move to exclusively post-quantum algorithms, having a pure PQ
   choice for public-key hybrid encryption is desireable.  HPKE is the
   leading modern protocol for public-key encryption, and ML-KEM as a
   post-quantum IND-CCA2-secure KEM fits nicely into HPKE's design.
   Supporting multiple security levels for ML-KEM allow a spectrum of
   use cases including settings where NIST PQ security category 5 is
   required.

1.2.  Not an authenticated KEM

   ML-KEM is a plain KEM that does not support the static-ephemeral key
   exchange that allows HPKE based on Diffie-Hellman based KEMs its
   (optional) authenticated modes.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Construction

   We construct 'wrapper' KEMs based on ML-KEM to bind the encapsulated
   shared secret ciphertext into the shared secret value, such that the
   final KEM has similar binding security properties as the original
   DHKEM HPKE was designed around.

   The encapsulation and decapsulation keys are computed, serialized,
   and deserialized the same as in [FIPS203].

   We use HKDF-SHA256 and HKDF-SHA512 as the HPKE KDFs and AES-128-GCM
   and AES-256-GCM as the AEADs for ML-KEM-768 and ML-KEM-1024
   respectively.

3.1.  Encap and Decap

   ~~ def Encap(pkR): ss, ct = MLKEM.Encaps(pkR)

   shared_secret = ExtractAndExpand(ss, ct)

   return shared_secret, ct ~~

   ~~ def Decap(enc, skR): ss, ct = MLKEM.Decaps(enc, skR)

   shared_secret = ExtractAndExpand(ss, ct)

   return shared_secret, ct ~~

3.2.  AuthEncap and AuthDecap

   HPKE-ML-KEM is not an authenticeted KEM and does not support
   AuthEncap() or AuthDecap(), see Section 1.2.

4.  Security Considerations

   HPKE's IND-CCA2 security relies upon the IND-CCA2 security of the
   underlying KEM and AEAD schemes.  ML-KEM is believed to be IND-CCA
   secure via multiple analyses.

   The HPKE key schedule is independent of the encapsulated KEM shared
   secret ciphertext of the ciphersuite KEM, and dependent on the shared
   secret produced by the KEM.  If HPKE had committed to the
   encapsulated shared secret ciphertext, we wouldn't have to worry
   about the binding properties of the ciphersuite KEM's X-BIND-K-CT
   properties.  These computational binding properties for KEMs were
   formalized in [CDM23].

   ML-KEM, unlike DHKEM, is also an implicitly-rejecting instantiation
   of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform, meaning the ML-KEM output shared
   secret may be computed differently in case of decryption failure,
   that reults in different binding properties, such as the lack of X-
   BIND-CT-PK and X-BIND-CT-K completely.

   The DHKEM construction in HPKE provides MAL-BIND-K-PK and MAL-BIND-
   K-CT security (the shared secret 'binds' or uniquely determines the
   encapsulation key and the encapsualted shared secret ciphertext),
   where the adversary is able to create the key pairs any way they like
   in addition to the key generation.  ML-KEM as specified provides
   LEAK-BIND-PK,K-CT security, where the involved key pairs are output
   by the key generation algorithm of the KEM and then leaked to the
   adversary.  LEAK-BIND-PK,K-CT is a weaker property than the DHKEM
   properties as it is not resistant in the presence of an actively
   malicious adversary, and requires both the shared secret _and_the
   public key together to uniquely bind the ciphertext, so its shared
   secret alone is insufficient.

   This results in a wrapper construction around ML-KEM to bind to the
   encapsulated shared secret ciphertext as the kem_context provided to
   ExtractAndExpand().  This binds the final shared_secret (K) to the
   encapsulated shared secret ciphertext (CT), achieving MAL-BIND-K-CT.
   ML-KEM already is MAL-BIND-K-PK as the hash of the encapsulation key
   (PK) is an input the computation of the shared secret (K).  Together
   this wrapper KEM matches the binding properties of HPKE's default KEM
   construction DHKEM in being MAL-BIND-K-CT and MAL-BIND-K-PK.

Appendix C.  Test Vectors

   This section contains test vectors formatted similary to that which
   are found in [RFC9180], with two changes.  First, we only provide
   vectors for the non-authenticated modes of operation.  Secondly, as
   ML-KEM encapsulation does not involve an ephemeral keypair, we omit
   the ikmE, skEm, pkEm entries and provide an ier entry instead.  The
   value of ier is the randomness used to encapsulate, so ier[0:32] is
   the seed that is fed to H in the first step of ML-KEM encapsulation
   in [FIPS203].
